## `Output` directory

### `Simulation_1` directory

`Simulation_1` directory contains the output of the four random effect models used in the simulation study of Section 4.1.

The directory for the [Method] random effect analysis  `Output/Simulation1/[Method]` contains two directories: 
  - `RData` directory
      - `rep_X.RData` contains 10,000 posterior draws of **μ** and **Σ** (after burn-in) for the X-th simulated data (out of 300). 
  - `DiagnosticPlot` directory
      -  The diagnostic plot of **μ** will be stored here (while running MCMC).

### `Simulation_2` directory

`Simulation_2` directory contains the output of the four random effect models used in the simulation study of Section 4.2. Its structure is the same as that of `Simulation_1` directory.

### `Application_Study` directory
  
The directory contains the outputs of the real data analysis in Section 5.
  - `IPD_AD_Posterior.RData` contains the result of our proposed method (generated by the script `I-WIP_Application_CodeOnly.R`)
      - It contains 10,000 posterior draws of **μ** and **Σ** (after burn-in).  
  - `IPDonly_Posterior.RData` contains the result of IPD-only analysis.
  - `FixedEffect.xlsx` contains the result of the integrated fixed-effect analysis. 

### `Figure_Table` directory

The directory contains the tables in the Supplementary Material and the figures in the main text. 
  - `Supplement_Table4.csv` Table 4 of the Supplementary Material, generated with `Code/Figure_Table/Supplement_Table4.R`
  - `Supplement_Table5.csv` Table 5 of the Supplementary Material, generated with `Code/Figure_Table/Supplement_Table5.R`
  - `Maintext_Figure3.png` Figure 3 of the main text, generated with `Code/Figure_Table/Main_Figure3.R`
  - `Maintext_Figure4.png` Figure 4 of the main text, generated with `Code/Figure_Table/Main_Figures4and5`
  - `Maintext_Figure5.png` Figure 5 of the main text, generated with `Code/Figure_Table/Main_Figures4and5`
