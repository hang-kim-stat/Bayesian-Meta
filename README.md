# **Supplementary Materials for ''Bayesian Random-Effects Meta-Analysis Integrating Individual Participant Data and Aggregate Data''**  

This repository follows the same structure as [the JASA reproducibility materials template on GitHub](https://github.com/jasa-acs/repro-template).

## `code` Directory 

### Codes for Simulation Studies

The directory has R codes for two simulation studies in Section 4 of the main text and our I-WIP meta-analysis study in Section 5. 

Each simulation study folder (`Simulation_1` and `Simulation_2`) contains codes for four methods: 
  - `1_Benchmark.R` Random-effects analysis using all 40 simulation IPD studies
  - `2_IPD-AD.R` Proposed meta-analysis with 10 IPD studies and 30 AD studies
  - `3_IPD-AD-pooled.R` Proposed meta-analysis with a mis-specification density ratio model
  - `4_IPD_only.R` Random-effects analysis using only 10 IPD studies

**Input**
  - The R codes use the simulation data stored in the `data` folder.
  - A default setting is to import the 1st simulation dataset (out of 300 repeated simulations).
      - Other simulation dataset can be used by changing `rep_no` (in Line 3 of each R code) to a number from 1 to 300.
      - The authors used a batch script to run the 300 repeated simulations in multiple cores in parallel. 

**Output**
  - Posterior values from the MCMC (after burn-in) are stored in `output/[MethodName]/RData` directory.
      - If you run an R code in the `code` directory, the output file for the 1st simulation data `rep_1.RData` will be produced.
      - For your convenience, the output files for all 300 simulation studies are already stored in the  `output/[MethodName]/RData` directory.
  - The current default setting `DrawDiagnostics = TRUE` on Line 14 will produce the diagnostic plot (while running MCMC) and store it in `output/[Simulation_Number]/[MethodName]/DiagnosticPlot` directory.
  - `W_Summary.R` generates two tables used for Figure 3 in the main text and Tables 5 and 6 in the Supplementary Materials. 

### Code for **I-WIP Meta-analysis Study**

`I-WIP_Application_CodeOnly.R` is the code we used to apply our proposed method to the real data. 
  - The data are not released here for [ REASON ].  

## `data` directory 

The directory contains the two simulation datasets (`SimulationData_1.RData` and `SimulationData_2.RData`) used for Section 4.1 and 4.2 of the main text, respectively.
  - The datasets were generated by running `Generate_Simulation_1.R` and `Generate_Simulation_2.R`.
  - `README.md` in the directory explains the variable names in the code by referring to the notations in the main text.  

## `output` directory 

Each folder contains the outputs of each method generated by implementing the R codes in `code/[Simulation_Number]/[MethodName]` folder. 
  - Two .csv files for each simulation setting were generated by running `W_Summary.R` in `code/[Simulation_Number]/[MethodName]` folder.
      - `Table_for_Supplementary.csv` produces the numerical results in Tables 4 and 5 of the Supplementary Material.
      - `Table_for_Figure.csv` makes Figure 3 in the main text.
