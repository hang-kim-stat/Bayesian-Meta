## `Data` directory  

The directory contains the two simulated data files (`SimulationData_1.RData` and `SimulationData_2.RData`) used for Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the main text, respectively.
  - The data files were generated by running `Generate_Simulation_1.R` and `Generate_Simulation_2.R`

### Simulation settings

As introduced in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the main text, we assume L=40 studies, each with n<sub>l</sub>=200 subjects. The number of covariates in each study is p=4. 

### Objects in `SimulationData_X.RData`

The objects in the data file are explained below, referring to the notations in the main text. 
  - **True parameters**
      - `theta_l_mat`: (L x p) matrix containing <b>θ</b><sub>l</sub> of L studies
      - `true_mu`: <b>μ</b> as the mean of <b>θ</b><sub>l</sub>
      - `true_kappa`: κ<sub>l</sub> as the variance of ε<sub>li</sub> (for Simulation Setting 1 only)
  - **IPD**
      - `X_cube`: (L x n<sub>l</sub> x p) cube containing the design matrice <b>X</b><sub>l</sub> of L studies
      - `Y_mat`: (L x n<sub>l</sub>) matrix containing the responses <b>y</b><sub>l</sub> of L studies
  - **AD**
      - `beta_mat`: (L x p) matrix containing the working model solution β&#770;<sub>l</sub> of L studies
      - `V_beta_cube`: (L x p x p) cube containing the working variance V<sub>β,l</sub> of L studies
      - `type_vec`: vector of types of L studies (for Simulation Setting 1 only)
          - The values 1, 2, and 3 denote AD Type 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
          - The value 4 denotes IPD.
